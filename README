This project was too large for GitHub and so it is on my student GitLab:
https://gitlab.com/wgu3153716/010854376_d387/-/tree/working_branch?ref_type=heads

This university project was an opportunity for me to write multithreaded object-oriented code using Java frameworks and determine how to deploy software applications using cloud services.

● Optimized a legacy backend for internationalization and localization of a multilingual Canadian hotel
● Increased processing efficiency by implementing multithreading for English and French welcome messages
● Productized application for cloud deployment using a containerized Docker image
